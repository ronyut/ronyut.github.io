## $ whoami
**Software Developer turned Security Researcher.**

I spent years building complex web applications before I started breaking them. This transition wasn't motivated by a career change, but by a fundamental curiosity about how systems fail at the architectural level.

### Why My Background Matters
Most security research identifies *what* is broken. Because of my engineering background, I focus on *why* it’s broken and *how* to refactor it.

* **Developer Intuition:** I can "smell" vulnerable patterns in code (like unsafe ORM usage or weak middleware logic) because I’ve written them myself.
* **Remediation First:** My write-ups don't just include a PoC (Proof of Concept); they include production-ready code fixes.
* **Automation:** I build my own custom tooling to fuzz APIs and audit source code, rather than relying solely on off-the-shelf scanners.

### Core Interests
* **Web Vulnerabilities:** Deep-dives into IDOR, Logic Flaws, and Auth Bypass.
* **Secure SDLC:** Helping teams integrate security into the actual build process.
* **Bug Bounty & Research:** Actively hunting for vulnerabilities in open-source projects and enterprise platforms.
