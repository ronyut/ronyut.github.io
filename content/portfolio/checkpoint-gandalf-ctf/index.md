### The Achievement
I secured **1st place** in the Check Point Product Organization (PO) AI Security CTF. This competition was launched following the acquisition of Lakera and was open to the entire Product Organization—a group of nearly 1,000 engineers and researchers under Nataly Kremer (CPO).

### The Challenge
The "Agent Breaker" contest required participants to bypass the guardrails of an AI-powered resume screening system. The goal was to use **Indirect Instruction Override (IIO)** to manipulate the AI into assigning a perfect score to a candidate, regardless of their actual qualifications.

### Impact & Recognition
* **Rank:** 1st Place overall.
* **Recognition:** Publicly announced during the PO all-hands meeting to the entire organization.
* **Technical Validation:** Successfully demonstrated how semantic vulnerabilities in LLMs can be exploited to bypass business logic.
